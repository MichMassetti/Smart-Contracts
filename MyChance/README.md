# MyChance

This project deals with a lottery, its tickets are NFTs and the users are allowed to decide the price of the tickets, which increase the probability of winning the the lottery (more expensive ticket, higher probability of win).

The funds are staked in Aave, therefore the winner prize involves the amount of interest generated by the total amount of funds staked on Aave. 

The platform can manage payment with Avax, Link Token and Stable Coin (Dai, USDT, USDC).

The back end is in Django and the Frontend in React JS.
