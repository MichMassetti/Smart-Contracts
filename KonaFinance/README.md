# KonaFinance

This project involves different entities, since it works with receivables.
The role of the smart contract is to get the loans from users and repay them with interests. 

Another technical aspect is the interaction with a ChainLink oracle, which automatically calls the APIs provided by our backend.

The smart contract is not published yet, but the web site is available.
The web3 application: https://kona.finance/.
