# Smart-Contracts

This repository contains some of the smart contracts that I worked on and their web3 applications.

For each project, I attached the code of the smart contracts and a brief overview of the project.

The code of the web3 applications in most of the cases is kept on private repositories, consequently, I'm not allowed to publsh them, thanks for the comprehension.
